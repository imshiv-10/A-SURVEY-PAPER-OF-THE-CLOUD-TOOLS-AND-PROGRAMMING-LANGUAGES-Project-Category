## Abstract: 

The main object of this project is a brief survey about cloud computing tools and programming languages. Cloud computing has many requirements to use the right tool with a supporting programming language effectively. Each tool has specific goals and features. For example, the Google app engine is used for infrastructure maintenance, and its primary concern is pay-as-you-go subscription, and it supports Python, PHP, .NET, and Java. In the same way, Cloud Hub, Puppet, and Kubernetes have specific features and supporting Languages. Cloud Computing tools mainly depend on cloud Services. 
This paper also discusses cloud Services like Iaas ( infrastructure as service ), Paas (Platform as service), and Saas( Software as Service ). Here, we also focus on resources in cloud computing like storage, database and networking, and structured and unstructured or semi-structured data types.

To provide context and background, we’ll explore various sources such as research papers, books, and articles. For our project, the relevant papers that we would be referring to are:
"The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing" by Peter Mell and Timothy Grance 
"The Serverless Trinity: Functions, Events, and Microservices" by Mike Roberts
"Serverless Computing: Current trends and open problems" by Florian Wessling et al. 
"A Survey of Cloud Service Models" by Dr. M. Manikandan and Dr. S. Pandian

Evaluating the results of a survey paper on state-of-the-art cloud tools and programming languages involves assessing the quality, relevance, and comprehensiveness of the information presented. Some ways we can evaluate the results are:
Inclusion of State-of-the-Art: We assess whether the survey paper effectively identifies and discusses state-of-the-art cloud tools and programming languages. This includes highlighting the latest technologies, platforms, and languages currently leading in the field.
Depth of Analysis: We can evaluate the depth of analysis for each topic covered. Are there in-depth discussions of the pros and cons of various tools and languages? Does the paper provide insights into their practical applications and limitations?
Comparative Analysis: We can also evaluate whether the paper compares different cloud tools and programming languages. It should help readers understand the trade-offs between various options and make informed decisions.
